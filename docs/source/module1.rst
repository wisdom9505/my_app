Module 1: User Management
==========================

This module handles user registration, authentication, and profile management, ensuring that users can easily create accounts, log in securely, and manage their personal information.

### Features
- **User Registration**: Allows new users to sign up by providing their details. This includes email validation and password strength checks.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and logout processes using Django's authentication system.
- **Profile Management**: Users can update their personal information, change their passwords, and manage their account settings.

### User Flow
1. **Registration**: Users fill out a registration form. Upon submission, the system validates the input and creates a new user account.
2. **Login**: Users enter their credentials to access their account. Successful authentication grants access to protected areas of the site.
3. **Profile Update**: Logged-in users can navigate to their profile settings to modify their details.

### Technical Details
- **Models**: Utilizes Django's built-in `User` model with extensions for additional fields (e.g., profile picture, bio).
- **Views**:
  - `UserRegistrationView`: Handles the registration logic, including form validation and user creation.
  - `UserLoginView`: Manages user authentication, including session management.
  - `ProfileUpdateView`: Allows users to update their profile information.

### Security
- Passwords are hashed using Django's secure hashing algorithm to protect user credentials.
- Implements CSRF protection on forms to prevent cross-site request forgery.
